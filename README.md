English => BrE IPA transcriber

Eventually, this is going to be a Chrome extension that will substitute English in Latin script for (British, for now) English transcribed in IPA in all (desired) webpages.

For now, it's an Oxford Dictionaries scraper and a mongo base of 17937 word:IPA pairs.

The original 20k-word list was procured from https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english
